There is no beat, no melody Burr, my first friend, my enemy Maybe the last face I ever see If I throw away my shot, is this how you’ll remember me? What if this bullet is my legacy? Legacy. What is a legacy? It’s planting seeds in a garden you never get to see I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me You let me make a difference A place where even orphan immigrants Can leave their fingerprints and rise up I’m running out of time. I’m running, and my time’s up Wise up. Eyes up I catch a glimpse of the other side Laurens leads a soldiers’ chorus on the other side My son is on the other side He’s with my mother on the other side Washington is watching from the other side Teach me how to say goodbye Rise up, rise up, rise up Eliza My love, take your time I’ll see you on the other side Raise a glass to freedom... <strong>[BURR AND COMPANY]</strong> He aims his pistol at the sky— <strong>[BURR]</strong> Wait! <strong>[BURR]</strong> I strike him right between his ribs I walk towards him, but I am ushered away They row him back across the Hudson I get a drink <strong>[COMPANY]</strong> Aaaah Aaaah Aaaah <strong>[BURR]</strong> I hear wailing in the streets <strong>[COMPANY]</strong> Aaaah Aaaah Aaaah <strong>[BURR]</strong> Somebody tells me, “You’d better hide.” <strong>[COMPANY]</strong> Aaaah Aaaah Aaaah <strong>[BURR]</strong> They say <strong>[BURR AND ANGELICA]</strong> Angelica and Eliza— <strong>[BURR]</strong> Were both at his side when he died Death doesn’t discriminate Between the sinners and the saints It takes and it takes and it takes History obliterates In every picture it paints It paints me and all my mistakes When Alexander aimed At the sky He may have been the first one to die But I’m the one who paid for it I survived, but I paid for it Now I’m the villain in your history I was too young and blind to see...
